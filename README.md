# Introduction to Python

> The Programming Club, Analytics Club, and CVI club are delighted to present to you the long-awaited Python Introductory Session. Python has slowly grown into one of the go-to programming languages for everything from an introduction to programming to high-performance machine learning due to its easy to learn syntax, intelligent interpreter, and wide support for efficient libraries. This session aims to give a short but comprehensive introduction to the world of Python programming.

In case of any questions, feel free to post them on [here](https://github.com/aryanpandey/Python_Session/discussions/4). **We strongly urge everyone to post their queries in the discussions tab** rather than personally contacting us to avoid repetitions. This also helps build a large compilation of questions that would be useful for everyone to refer to at any point in time. You can also check [here](https://github.com/aryanpandey/Python_Session/discussions/1) for some other resources which we will try to post from time to time.
